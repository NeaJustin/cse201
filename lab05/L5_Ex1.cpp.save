   Description: The program allows the user to be able to purchase items
		within the limits of their credit card. 

   Algorithm: to do this, the user inputs the amount of their credit limit,
	      and keeps track of the total things they buy. However, if they
	      go over the limit, their purchase will not go through and give 
	      an error. It is done by getting the credit limit and subtracting
	      it from the item they are purchasing. The other things are for
	      billing purposes. 
		total = credit_limit - item_purchased
		bool more= true;
		if(item_purchased > credit limit){
		   return true;
		}else
		   return false
